                        Episode 6. CANOPY <br> 2021
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        PLASTIC PRODUCT and NON-FICTION HOME have shown its Open Installation space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Allow me first to explain about the purpose of Open Installation since there are some customers who have asked about why I am holding an Open Installation exhibition, and what this is for. The very basic reason for Open Installation that displays canopies
                        lies in promoting PLASTIC PRODUCT via a different form of media instead of usual visual media like lookbooks or videos. A brand usually shows itself after making some products or building up its value, but I’d like to propose a
                        different media other than the commonly used ones by clothing brands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While preparing for the next lineup for PLASTIC PRODUCT, I contemplated if there were anything that I had ever observed for a long period of time or thought about for over 3 times in my life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I searched for the reason why I have been so caught up in canopies, and found that it was because canopies are both aesthetic and functional. However, the use of canopies is decreasing based on my experiences. This may be due to a trend that pursues removing
                        any decorative items while putting up with minor inconvenience. Thus, the current canopies are familiar but strange at the same time, and they are not as much functional as before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Canopies usually play their roles on rainy or snowy days, but when there is an umbrella or heavy rains and winds, canopies become not as useful as before or even useless. Nowadays, there are many entrances without canopies, and canopies are sometimes
                        excluded when planning a façade of the space. Nevertheless, I am still intrigued by canopies, and feeling that they have some small impact on my life. Thanks to canopies, I have been experiencing that canopies are expanding a range
                        of my thoughts and movements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Familiar but new canopies and the plastics that I am perceiving resemble each other, and I have wanted to explore these canopies. Initially, I did not plan to make a canopy, but buy one instead and set it up at any possible places. However, there were
                        not that many commercially available canopies, and of course nothing that could satisfy my needs. Later on, I wanted to make my canopy, show it and suggest using it to others. Then, I thought that selling my canopies would be the
                        most suitable way to do so. I made the canopies with my desire to recommend canopies, rather than thinking they would be sold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s why I requested a design for my canopy to NON-FICTION HOME whom I have talked about canopies with interests.
